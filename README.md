## Location-Based Alert System

The app includes a location-based alert system that shows emergency alerts to users when they are near tourist destinations in Aurora Province and there are active weather or safety alerts for those locations.

### How It Works

1. The app tracks user location every minute
2. When a user is near a tourist destination, it checks current weather conditions
